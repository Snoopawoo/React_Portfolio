                    I was born in Hungary where I spent my early years and have finished my studies as a Graphic and Multimedia Designer.
                    Right after this accomplishment, I moved to the UK and started working on some projects.
                    I appreciate art and design, and have a great passion to compete. Let it be art, work or games.
                    I aspire to become a better designer, and learn all the odds and ends of web development.
                    I have a lot of attention to detail, and I'm not affraid to put in the extra work to reach the resoult I desire.
